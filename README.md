# In order to get started properly we need to install Ruby and define some of our Ruby dependencies

1. Install ruby (if you don't already have it)
2. Install bundler and rspec `$gem install bundle`
3. create a Gemfile in the root of the directory with the following dependencies: 'serverspec', 'docker-api'
